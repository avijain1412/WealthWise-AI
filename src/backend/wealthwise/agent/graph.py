"""Capability 5 - Agents with LangGraph.

The conversational financial advisor. We use LangGraph's prebuilt ReAct agent,
which wires the LLM to the financial tools (calculators + RAG knowledge lookup)
and runs the reason -> act -> observe loop. A MemorySaver checkpointer gives
the agent stateful, multi-turn conversations per `thread_id`.
